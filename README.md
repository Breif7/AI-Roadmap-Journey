# My AI and Data Science Roadmap Journey

This repository documents my progress as I follow an 18-24 month roadmap to build my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. It serves as a portfolio of my projects, from foundational concepts to entrepreneurial applications.

## About The Roadmap

The goal is to move from foundational theory to practical, real-world problem-solving. This journey runs in parallel with my Master's degree in AI, focusing on building the practical muscle memory required in the industry.

## Projects Log

Here is a log of the projects and concepts I have covered so far.
